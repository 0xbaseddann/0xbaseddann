😊 Hi, I’m Dann, Wee Zi Jun
💡 As someone with a deep passion for technology and an innate sense of curiosity, I find myself constantly immersed in exploring new technologies and projects during my free time. I derive great satisfaction from tackling problems that challenge my conceptual thinking and creativity. Moreover, I relish the opportunities to expand my knowledge and gain valuable insights through self-directed learning and collaboration. 
🍀 Looking for opportunities to work in the Web3 field and collaborate to create something amazing!
